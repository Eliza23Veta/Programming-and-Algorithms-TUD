                                                          Principles of Object Oriented Programming

ENCAPSULATION: It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods
directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. 
Those types of variables are known as private variables.
A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc. The goal of information hiding is to ensure that
an object’s state is always valid by controlling access to attributes that are hidden from the outside world.

MODULARITY: Modularization is the technique of splitting a large programming task into smaller, separate, and manageable subtasks. Like most modern programming
languages, Python is a modular programming language. Python scripts are modularized through functions, modules, and packages.
The ability to make objects standalone so they can be resused (our modules). 

INHERITANCE: Inheritance is a process of obtaining properties and characteristics(variables and methods) of another class. In this hierarchical order, the class which
inherits another class is called subclass or child class, and the other class is the parent class. 

POLMORPHISM: the principle that one kind of thing can take a variety of forms. In the context of programming, this means that a single entity in a programming
language can behave in multiple ways depending on the context.
Operator polymorphism, or operator overloading, means that one symbol can be used to perform multiple operations. One of the simplest examples of this is the addition
operator +. Python’s addition operator works differently in relation to different data types.
Function polymorphism for Len() function. If applied to a string
